# Lab 02: Explore Azure AI Services

## Lab overview

In this lab, you will create an Azure AI multi-service resource, retrieve its keys and endpoint, and explore its capabilities using the Microsoft Foundry portal. You'll get hands-on experience with services like Face detection, without needing any coding skills.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Create an Azure AI services resource in the Azure portal
- Task 2: Check out the keys and endpoint
- Task 3: See Azure AI services in action

### Task 1: Create an Azure AI services resource

In this task, you will learn how to create an **Azure AI Services** resource to access various AI capabilities for your applications.

You can use Azure AI Face service with an **Azure AI services** multi-service resource. If you haven't already done so, create an **Azure AI services** resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, click the **＋ Create a resource** button.

1. Search for **Azure AI services (1)** and select **Azure AI services (2)** from the result.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Configure  the AI Service with the following settings:
   
    - **Subscription (1)**: Use the existing Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group (2)**: **AI-900-Module-02**
    - **Region (3)**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - **Name (4)**: Enter **contentsafety<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - **Pricing tier (5)**:Select **Standard S0**.
    - **By checking this box, I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below (6)**: *Selected*.
    - Click on **Review + create (7)** 

      ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod2-p2t1p3.png)
      
1. On the **Review + create** tab, select **Create** and wait for deployment to complete.

    >***Congrats! You've just created or provisioned an Azure AI services resource. The one you provisioned in particular is a multi-service resource.***

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

1. Select **contentsafety<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

### Task 2: Check out the keys and endpoint

In order to incorporate Azure AI services into applications, developers need a service key and endpoint. The keys and endpoint used for application development can be found in the Azure Portal. 

1. From the left navigation menu, under **Resource Management** section, select **Keys and Endpoint (1)**. Click on **Copy to clipboard** icon for **Key 1 (2)** and **Endpoints (3)**.

### Task 3: See Azure AI services in action

Let's start by creating an Microsoft Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com`.

1. If prompted, provide the credentials below:

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
 
1. In a new browser window, navigate to the [Azure AI services exploration page](https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices) at `https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices`.

1. On the *AI Services* page, select the **Vision + Document** tile to try out Azure AI Vision and Document capabilities.

    ![](./media/mod2-p2t3p1-1.png)

1. Under *View all other vision capabilities* select the **Face (1)** tab. Select the **Detect faces in an image (2)** demo tile.

    ![](./media/ai2l10.png)

1. Try out the Face service, which is one of many Azure AI services. Click on an image.

    ![](./media/mod2-p2t3p1.png)

1. Check out the detected attributes. 

    ![](./media/mod2-p2t3p2.png)

1. Scroll down to the **Run the code** section. Select **View Code (1)**. Scroll down to the section that starts with *import os*. In the sample code provided, you'll see placeholders where you could put a key and endpoint **(2)**.

    ![](./media/ai2l14.png)

1. If you were to build an application that used Azure AI services, you could start with the provided code. By replacing the placeholders with your own service's key and endpoint, your application would be able to send requests and receive responses that utilize Azure AI services. In the case of the Face service, the *request* is for the Face service to analyze the image. The *response* is the detected attributes. 

    >**Note**: You do not need to know programming to complete any of the exercises in this course. We will continue to take a look at Azure AI services in action through the Microsoft Foundry portal.
