# Detect faces in Vision Studio

## Lab overview

Vision solutions often require AI to be able to detect human faces. Suppose the fictitious retail company Northwind Traders wants to locate where customers are standing in a store to best assist them. One way to accomplish this is to determine if there are any faces in the images, and if so, to return the bounding box coordinates that show their location.

To test the face detection capabilities of the Azure AI Face service, you will use [Azure Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/). This is a UI-based platform that lets you explore Azure AI Vision features without needing to write any code.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
-  Task 1: Create an Azure AI services resource
-  Task 2: Connect Azure AI Service Resource to Vision Studio
-  Task 3: Detect faces in the Vision Studio

### Task 1: Create an Azure AI services resource

In this task, you will learn how to create an **Azure AI Services** resource to access various AI capabilities for your applications.

You can use Azure AI Face service with an **Azure AI services** multi-service resource. If you haven't already done so, create an **Azure AI services** resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, Click the **＋ Create a resource** button.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p2(1).png)

1. You will be taken to a page to create an Azure AI services resource. Please click on **+ Create**.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p3.png)

1. Configure it with the following settings:
   
    - **Subscription (1)**: Use the existing Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group (2)**: **AI-900-Module-04-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**
    - **Region (3)**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - **Name (4)**: Enter **detectvision<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - **Pricing tier (5)**:Select **Standard S0**.
    - **By checking this box I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below (6)**: *Selected*.
    - Click **Review + create (7)** 

      ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p4.png)

1. On the **Review + create** tab, select **Create** and wait for deployment to complete.

### Task 2: Connect your Azure AI service resource to Vision Studio

In this task, you will learn how to connect your **Azure AI Services** resource to Vision Studio to enable AI-powered image analysis.

1. Open a new browser tab and go to **Vision Studio** at [https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Click on **Sign in** in the top right corner, then log in with your account. Make sure you're using the same directory where you created your Azure AI services resource.

   ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/4-6.png)

   >**Note:** If the **Welcome to the new Vision Studio** pop-up appears, click on **Close**.

   ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p6.png)

1. On the Vision Studio home page, select **View all resources** under the **Getting started with Vision** heading.

    ![The View all resource link is highlighted under Getting started with Vision in Vision Studio.](./media/analyze-images-vision/vision-resources.png)

1. On the **Select a resource to work with** page, make sure the resource you created above appears in the list. 

    > **Note**: If your resource isn't listed, try **Refreshing** the page.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/ai-900-0298.png)
   
1. Close the page by selecting the **X** at the top right of the screen.

### Task 3: Detect faces in the Vision Studio 

In this task, you will learn how to detect faces in Vision Studio to analyze facial attributes and recognize individuals.

1. On the **Get started with Azure Al Face API** landing page, scroll down to the **Face** section and then select the **Detect faces in an image** tile.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t3p1.png)

1. Under the **Try It Out** subheading, acknowledge the resource usage policy by reading and checking the box **(1)** and click on the **Please select a resource (2)**.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t3p2.png)

1. On the **Select an Azure resource** page, choose your existing **Subscription (1)** from the drop-down menu, then select the **AI service (2)** resource from the **Azure Resources** drop-down, and click **Confirm (3)**.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t3p3.png)

1. **Check** the Acknowledge box once more.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t3p4.png)

1. Select each of the sample images and observe the face detection data that is returned.

1. Copy the link [**https://aka.ms/mslearn-detect-faces**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-detect-faces) and paste it into a new tab to download **detect-faces.zip**. 

1. Click the **Download icon (1)** to view your downloads, then click the **Folder icon (2)** to open the file location.
