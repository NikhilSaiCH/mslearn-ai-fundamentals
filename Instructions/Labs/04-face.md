# Module 04: Detect faces in Vision Studio

## Lab overview

Vision solutions often require AI to be able to detect human faces. Suppose the fictitious retail company Northwind Traders wants to locate where customers are standing in a store to best assist them. One way to accomplish this is to determine if there are any faces in the images, and if so, to return the bounding box coordinates that show their location.

To test the face detection capabilities of the Azure AI Face service, you will use [Azure Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/). This is a UI-based platform that lets you explore Azure AI Vision features without needing to write any code.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
-  Task 1: Create an Azure AI services resource
-  Task 2: Connect Azure AI Service Resource to Vision Studio
-  Task 3: Detect faces in the Vision Studio

### Task 1: Create an Azure AI services resource

In this task, you will learn how to create an **Azure AI Services** resource to access various AI capabilities for your applications.

You can use Azure AI Face service with an **Azure AI services** multi-service resource. If you haven't already done so, create an **Azure AI services** resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal,  search for **Azure AI services (1)**. Select an **Azure AI services multi-service account(2)**.

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Click the **&#65291;Create a resource** button and search for *Azure AI services*. Select **create** an **Azure AI services** plan. You will be taken to a page to create an Azure AI services resource. Configure it with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*.
    - **Resource group**: *Select or create a resource group with a unique name*.
    - **Region**: *Select the closest geographical region. If in eastern US, use "East US 2"*.
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*.
    - **Pricing tier**: *Standard S0.*
    - **By checking this box I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below**: *Selected*.

1. You will be taken to a page to create an Azure AI services resource. Please click on **+ Create** Configure it with the following settings:
   
    - **Subscription (1)**: Use the existing Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group (2)**: **AI-900-Module-04-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**
    - **Region (3)**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - **Name (4)**: Enter **detectvision<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - **Pricing tier (5)**:Select **Standard S0**.
    - **By checking this box I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below (6)**: *Selected*.
    - Click **Review + create (7)**

### Task 2: Connect your Azure AI service resource to Vision Studio

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. In another browser tab, navigate to **Vision Studio** at [https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
=======
In this task, you will learn how to connect your **Azure AI Services** resource to Vision Studio to enable AI-powered image analysis.
>>>>>>> 20a06afb6504d7ebfb91f217980cf0897bf34e2e

1. Open a new browser tab and go to **Vision Studio** at [https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Click on **Sign in** in the top right corner, then log in with your account. Make sure you're using the same directory where you created your Azure AI services resource. If a pop-up appears asking you to select a resource, click the **X** icon to close it.

   ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/4-6.png)

1. On the Vision Studio home page, select **View all resources** under the **Getting started with Vision** heading.

    ![The View all resource link is highlighted under Getting started with Vision in Vision Studio.](./media/analyze-images-vision/vision-resources.png)

1. On the **Select a resource to work with** page, make sure the resource you created above appears in the list. 

    > **Note**: If your resource isn't listed, try **Refreshing** the page.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/ai-900-02.png)
   
1. Close the settings page by selecting the **x** at the top right of the screen.

### Task 3: Detect faces in the Vision Studio 

In this task, you will learn how to detect faces in Vision Studio to analyze facial attributes and recognize individuals.

1. In a web browser, navigate to **Vision Studio** at [https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. On the **Getting started with Vision** landing page, select the **Face** tab and then select the **Detect Faces in an image** tile.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/lab4-1.png)

1. Under the **Try It Out** subheading, acknowledge the resource usage policy by reading and checking the box.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/lab4-4.png)

1. Select each of the sample images and observe the face detection data that is returned.

1. Copy highlighted link by right-clicking the [**https://aka.ms/mslearn-detect-faces**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-detect-faces) and selecting "Copy" from the context menu and paste it into the new tab to download **detect-faces.zip**. 

1. Click the **download icon (1)** to view your downloads, then click the **folder icon (2)** to open the file location.

1. Locate the file named **store-camera-2.jpg**; which contains the following image:

    ![An image of more people in a store.](./media/create-face-solutions/store-camera-2.jpg)

1. Upload **store-camera-2.jpg** and review the face detection details that are returned.

1. Locate the file named **store-camera-3.jpg**; which contains the following image:

    ![An image of people in a store with a plant obscuring a face.](./media/create-face-solutions/store-camera-3.jpg)

1. Upload **store-camera-3.jpg** and review the face detection details that are returned. Notice how Azure AI Face did not detect the face that is obscured.
