# Module 03: Analyze images in the Azure AI Foundry portal

## Lab overview
>>>>>>> 20a06afb6504d7ebfb91f217980cf0897bf34e2e

**Azure AI Vision** includes numerous capabilities for understanding image content and context and extracting information from images. In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Vision in Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to analyze images using the built-in try-it-out experiences. 

Suppose the fictitious retailer *Northwind Traders* has decided to implement a "smart store", in which AI services monitor the store to identify customers requiring assistance, and direct employees to help them. By using Azure AI Vision, images taken by cameras throughout the store can be analyzed to provide meaningful descriptions of what they depict.

   ![](./media/3-12.png)

1. The **Dense Captions** feature differs from the **Caption** capability in that it provides multiple human-readable captions for an image, one describing the image's content and others, each covering the essential objects detected in the picture. Each detected object includes a bounding box, which defines the pixel coordinates within the image associated with the object.

1. Hover over one of the captions in the **Detected** **attributes** list and observe what happens within the image.

    ![](./media/3-13.png)
>>>>>>> 20a06afb6504d7ebfb91f217980cf0897bf34e2e

1. Move your mouse cursor over the other captions in the list, and notice how the bounding box shifts in the image to highlight the portion of the image used to generate the caption.

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Upload the **store-camera-2.jpg** file.

1. Review the list of tags extracted from the image and the confidence score for each in the detected attributes panel. Here the confidence score is the likelihood that the text for the detected attribute describes what is actually in the image. Notice in the list of tags that it includes not only objects, but actions, such as *shopping*, *selling*, and *standing*.
