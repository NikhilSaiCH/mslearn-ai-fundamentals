## Task 3: Explore generative AI in Microsoft Foundry's chat playground

In this task, you will learn how to interact with the Chat playground in Microsoft Foundry, deploy a generative AI model, and optimize responses using effective prompting techniques.

1. In Microsoft Foundry's Portal page, click **Open in playgrounds**

    ![](./media/lab12-12-11.png)

1. Consider the following ways you can improve responses from a generative AI assistant:
    - Start with a specific goal for what you want the assistant to do
    - Iterate based on previous prompts and responses to refine the result
    - Provide a source to ground the response in a specific scope of information
    - Add context to maximize response appropriateness and relevance
    - Set clear expectations for the response

1. Let's try generating a response using a prompt with a specific goal. In the chat box, enter the following prompt **(1)** and click on the **Send (2)** button.

    ```prompt
    I'm planning a trip to Paris in September. Can you help me?
    ```

    ![](./media/lab12-12-12.png)

1. Review the response. **Note**: Keep in mind that the specific response you receive may vary due to the nature of generative AI.

   ![](./media/ai900m12-7.png)
 
1. Let's try another prompt. Enter the following:

    ```prompt
    Where's a good location in Paris to stay? 
    ```

   ![](./media/AI-l12-7.png)

1. Review the response, which should provide some places to stay in Paris.

    ![](./media/AI-l12-8.png)

1. Let's iterate based on previous prompts and responses to refine the result. Enter the following prompt:
    
    ```prompt
    Can you give me more information about dining options near the first location?
    ``` 

     ![](./media/AI-l12-9.png)

1. Review the response, which should provide dining options near the location mentioned in the previous response. 

   ![](./media/AI-l12-10.png)

1. Now, let's provide a source to ground the response in a specific scope of information. Enter the following: 
    
    ```prompt
    Based on the information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Paris, what were the key events in the city's history?
    ```
    ![](./media/AI-l12-11.png)

1. Review the response, which should provide information based on the provided website. 

   ![](./media/AI-l12-12.png)   

1. When you are done, you can close the browser window.
