# Use Question Answering with the Language Studio

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you will use Language Studio to create and train a knowledge base of questions and answers. Content for the knowledge base will come from an existing FAQ page on the website of Margie’s Travel, a fictitious travel agency. You will then use Language Studio to see how it would work when used by customers.

Azure AI Language includes *question answering* capabilities, which you will use to create a knowledge base. Knowledge bases can be created either by entering question and answer pairs manually or from an existing document or web page. Margie’s Travel wants to use its existing FAQ document.

The Language service's question answering feature enables you to quickly create a knowledge base, either by entering question and answer pairs or from an existing document or web page. It can then use some built-in natural language processing capabilities to interpret questions and find appropriate answers.

   ![Creating a Language Service resource with custom question answering enabled.](media/ai900m7-14.png)

1. The response `Hi` should be returned.   

   ![Creating a Language Service resource with custom question answering enabled.](media/ai900m7-15.png)
   
1. In the test pane, at the bottom, enter the message `I want to book a flight` and press Enter. An appropriate response from the FAQ should be returned.

   ![Creating a Language Service resource with custom question answering enabled.](media/ai900m7-16.png)

    > **Note**: The response contains both a short answer and a detailed answer passage. The passage provides the full text from the FAQ document for the closest matched question, while the short answer is intelligently extracted from it. You can control the inclusion of the short answer by using the **Include short answer** checkbox at the top of the test pane.

1. Try another question, such as `How can I cancel a reservation?` and press Enter.

   ![Creating a Language Service resource with custom question answering enabled.](media/ai900m7-17.png)
