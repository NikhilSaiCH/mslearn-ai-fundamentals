   ![](./media/lab5a-e1t2p13.png)

1. Submit prompts that include the other images, such as `How should I cook this?` or `What desserts could I make with this?`

### View code

To develop a client app or agent that can use the model to interpret images, you can use the OpenAI **Responses** API.

1. In the **Chat** pane, select the **Code** tab to view sample code.

    ![](./media/lab5a-e1t2p14.png)

1. Select the following code options:
    - **API**: Responses API
    - **Language**: Python
    - **SDK**: OpenAI SDK
    - **Authentication**: Key authentication

    The default sample code includes only a text-based prompt. To submit a prompt that analyzes an image, you can modify the **input** parameter to include both text and image content, as shown here:

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    
    endpoint = "https://your-project-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/"
    deployment_name = "gpt-4.1-mini"
    api_key = "<your-api-key>"
    
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url=endpoint,
        api_key=api_key
    )
    
    response = client.responses.create(
        model=deployment_name,
        input=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?"},
                {"type": "input_image", "image_url": "https://an-online-image.jpg"},
            ],
        }],
    )
    
    print(f"answer: {response.output[0]}")
    ```

    > **Tip**: If you are using a work or school account to sign into Azure, and you have sufficient permissions in the Azure subscription, you can open the sample code in VS Code for Web to experiment with image-based input content. You can obtain the **key** for your service in the **Code** tab of the model playground (above the sample code) and you can use the image **[orange.jpg](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/data/orange.jpg){:target="_blank"}** at `https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/data/orange.jpg`. To learn more about using rhe OpenAI API to analyze images, see the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision#analyze-images).

## Summary

In this exercise, you explored how to deploy and use vision-enabled generative AI models in Microsoft Foundry. You analyzed images, generated new images from text prompts, and created videos using generative AI models.

The scenarios in this exercise demonstrate how easily you can get started building applications that understand and generate visual content. From this foundation, you could build richer AI solutions that combine image analysis, image generation, and video generation to support advanced real-world use cases.
