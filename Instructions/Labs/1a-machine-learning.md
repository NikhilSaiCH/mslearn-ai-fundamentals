You will search for Machine Learning, configure the necessary settings like subscription, resource group, and workspace name, and deploy the resource. Once deployed, you will access the workspace through Azure Machine Learning Studio.

1. In the Azure Portal, select **+ Create a resource** and search for **Machine Learning**.

    - **Storage account**: Note the default new storage account that will be created for your workspace. **(5)**
    - **Key vault**: Note the default new key vault that will be created for your workspace. **(6)**
    - **Application insights**: Note the default new application insights resource that will be created for your workspace. **(7)**
    - **Container registry**: None (one will be created automatically the first time you deploy a model to a container) **(8)**

5. Select **Review + create (9)**.

#### Enable preview features

Some features of Azure Machine Learning are in preview and need to be explicitly enabled in your workspace.

1. In Azure Machine Learning Studio, click on **manage preview features** (the loud speaker icon - &#128363;).

### Task 2: Use automated machine learning to train a model

In this task, you will learn how to use automated machine learning to train a model efficiently without writing extensive code.

Automated machine learning enables you to try multiple algorithms and parameters to train multiple models, and identify the best one for your data. In this exercise, you'll use a dataset of historical bicycle rental details to train a model that predicts the number of bicycle rentals that should be expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological features.

1. Select **Submit training job**. It starts automatically.

   ![](media/ai900j13.png)

1. Wait for the job to finish. It might take around `10-15 minutes`, while — now might be a good time for a coffee break!

**Review the best model**

When the automated machine learning job has completed, you can review the best model it trained.

1. On the **Overview** tab of the automated machine learning job, note the best model summary.

    ![](media/lab1-2.png)

    > **Note**: You may see a message under the status "Warning: User specified exit score reached...". This is an expected message. Please continue to the next step.
  
1. Select the text under **Algorithm name** for the best model to view its details.

    ![](media/ai900-4.png)

1. Select the **Metrics** tab and select the **residuals** and **predicted_true** charts if they are not already selected. 

    ![](media/ai900--5.png)

    >**Note:** Review the charts which show the performance of the model. The **residuals** chart shows the *residuals* (the differences between predicted and actual values) as a histogram. The **predicted_true** chart compares the predicted values against the true values.

### Task 3: Deploy and test the model

1. On the **Model** tab for the best model trained by your automated machine learning job, select **Deploy (1)** and use the **Real-time endpoint (2)** option to deploy the model with the following settings:

   - **Instance count**: 3 (1) 
    - **Virtual machine**: Standard_DS3_v2 (2)
    - **Endpoint**: New (3)
    - **Endpoint name**: *Leave the default name* (4)
    - **Deployment name**: *Leave default* (5)
    - **Inferencing data collection**: *Disabled* (6)
    - **Package Model**: *Disabled* (7)

    ![](media/ai900j15.png)

    ![](media/ai900j16.png)

1. Select **Deploy (8)**

1. Wait for the **Deploy status** to change to *Succeeded*. This may take 5-10 minutes.

   >**Note**: Check the **Notifications** bar to verify the status of the operation.

### Task 4: Test the deployed service

Now you can test your deployed service.

1. In Azure Machine Learning studio, on the left hand menu, select **Endpoints** and open the **Real-timeendpoint**. in the page.

1. On the *real-time endpoint* page view the **Test** tab.

    ![](media/ai900j17.png)

1. In the **Input data to test endpoint** pane, replace the template JSON with the following input data:

    ```json
      {
     "input_data": {
       "columns": [
         "day",
         "mnth",
         "year",
         "season",
         "holiday",
         "weekday",
         "workingday",
         "weathersit",
         "temp",
         "atemp",
         "hum",
         "windspeed"
       ],
       "index": [0],
       "data": [[1,1,2022,2,0,1,1,2,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]]
     }
    }

    ```

1. Click the **Test** button.

    ![](media/ai900j18.png)

1. Review the test results, which include a predicted number of rentals based on the input features - similar to this:

    ```JSON
    [
      357.5136388769763
    ]
    ```

    The test pane took the input data and used the model you trained to return the predicted number of rentals.

Let's review what you have done. You used a dataset of historical bicycle rental data to train a model. The model predicts the number of bicycle rentals expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological *features*.
