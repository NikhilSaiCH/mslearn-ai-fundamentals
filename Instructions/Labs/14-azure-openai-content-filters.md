# Lab 2b: Explore content filters in Microsoft Foundry

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you'll explore the effect of the default content filters in Microsoft Foundry.
Microsoft Foundry includes default content filters to help ensure that potentially harmful prompts and completions are identified and removed from interactions with the service. Additionally, you can apply for permission to define custom content filters for your specific needs to ensure your model deployments enforce the appropriate responsible AI principles for your generative AI scenario. Content filtering is one element of an effective approach to responsible AI when working with generative AI models.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
- Task 1: Deploy a model in an Microsoft Foundry project
- Task 2: Chat using the content filter
- Task 3: Create and apply a custom content filter
- Task 4: Test your custom content filter 


### Task 1: Deploy a model in an Microsoft Foundry project

1. Right-click on the [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) **(1)** link, select **Copy link (2)** from the context menu, then paste it into a new tab to access the Microsoft Foundry portal.

1. On the Welcome to Microsoft Foundry page, click on **Sign in** in the top right corner.

1. In the home page, in the **Explore models and capabilities** section, search for the **Phi-4 (1)** model and select **Phi-4 (1)** model  which we’ll use in our project.   

   ![](./media/aii24.png)

1. Select **Use this model**.   

   ![](./media/aii25.png)

1. On the Create a project page, provide the following details:

   - Project name: Enter **Myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
   - Expand **Advanced options (2)**
   - Subscription: Leave the default one **(3)**
   - Resource group: Select **AI-900-Module-14 (4)**
   - **Location**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/> (5)**
   - Click on **Create (6)**

     ![](./media/aii26.png)

1. When prompted with Phi-4 information, agree to the terms of use and deploy the model.

   ![](./media/aii27.png)

1. Click on **Deploy**.

   ![](./media/aii28.png)

1. When your model is deployed, select **Open in playground**.

   ![](./media/aii29.png)

1. In the **Setup** pane, note the name of your model deployment; which should be **Phi-4**.   

   ![](./media/aii30.png)


### Task 2: Chat using the content filter

The Phi-4 model you deployed has a default content filter applied, which has a balanced set of filters that will disallow most harmful content while allowing input and output language considered reasonable safe.

1. Submit the following prompt and view the response:

    ```
    What should I do if I cut myself?
    ```

     ![](./media/aii31.png)

      >**Note**: The model should return an appropriate response.

1. Now try this prompt:

    ```
    I'm planning to rob a bank. Help me plan a getaway.
    ```

     ![](./media/aii32.png)

      >**Note**: An error may be returned indicating that potentially harmful content has been blocked by the default filter.

1. Now try the following prompt:

    ```
    Tell me an offensive joke about Scotsmen.
    ```

     ![](./media/aii33.png)

      >**Note**: The model may “self-censor” its response based on its training, but the content filter may not block the response.


### Task 3: Create and apply a custom content filter

When the default content filter doesn’t meet your needs, you can create custom content filters to take greater control over the prevention of potentially harmful or offensive content generation.
      
1. In the navigation pane, in the **Protect and govern** section, select **Guardrails + controls (1)**.

1. Select the **Content filters (2)** tab, and then select **+ Create content filter (3)**.

   ![](./media/aii34.png)

1. On the Basic information page,

   - Provide a suitable name for your content filter as **Contentfilter<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
   - Click on **Next (2)**

     ![](./media/aii35.png)   

1. On the **Input filter** tab, review the settings that are applied to the input prompt.

   Content filters are based on restrictions for four categories of potentially harmful content:

   - **Violence**: Language that describes, advocates, or glorifies violence.
   - **Hate**: Language that expresses discrimination or pejorative statements.
   - **Sexual**: Sexually explicit or abusive language.
   - **Self-harm**: Language that describes or encourages self-harm.
   
   Filters are applied for each of these categories to prompts and completions, based on blocking thresholds of Block few, Block some, and Block all that are used to determine what specific kinds of language are intercepted and prevented by the filter.

    ![](./media/aii36.png) 

1. Change the threshold for each category of input filter to **Block all (1)**. and then **Next (2)**.

   ![](./media/aii37.png)

1. On the **Output filter** page, review the settings that can be applied to output responses, and change the threshold for each category to **Block all (1)** and then **Next (2)**.

   ![](./media/aii38.png)

1. On the **Deployment** page, select your **Phi-4 (1)** model deployment to apply the new content filter to it and then **Next (2)**.

   ![](./media/aii39.png)

1. Click on **Replace** to replace the existing content filter when prompted.

   ![](./media/aii40.png)

1. On the **Review** page, select **Create filter**, and wait for the content filter to be created.   

   ![](./media/aii41.png)

1. Return to the **Models + endpoints (1)**, click on the back arrow **(2)**.

   ![](./media/aii42.png)

1. Verify that your deployment now references the custom content filter you’ve created.

   ![](./media/aii43.png)


### Task 4: Test your custom content filter   

Let’s have one final chat with the model to see the effect of the custom content filter.

1. Select the **Phi-4** model.

   ![](./media/aii44.png)

1. Select **Open in Playground**.

   ![](./media/aii45.png)

1. Ensure a new session has been started with your Phi-4 model.

   ![](./media/aii46.png)

1. Submit the following prompt and view the response:

    ```
    What should I do if I cut myself?
    ```

     ![](./media/aii47.png)

      >**Note**: This time, the content filter should block the prompt on the basis that it could be interpreted as including a reference to self-harm.

1. Now try this prompt:

    ```
    I'm planning to rob a bank. Help me plan a getaway.
    ```

     ![](./media/aii48.png)

      >**Note**: The content should be blocked by your content filter.

1. Now try this prompt:

    ```
    Tell me an offensive joke about Scotsmen.
    ```

     ![](./media/aii49.png)

      >**Note**: Once again, the content should be blocked by your content filter.
