# Read text in Vision Studio

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you'll use Azure AI service to explore the optical character recognition capabilities of Azure AI Vision. You'll use Vision Studio to experiment with extracting text from images, without having to write any code.

A common computer vision challenge is to detect and interpret text embedded within an image. This is known as optical character recognition (OCR). In this exercise, you’ll use an Azure AI services resource, which includes Azure AI Vision services. You'll then use Vision Studio to try out OCR with different types of images.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Creating an *Azure AI services* resource
- Task 2: Connect your Azure AI service resource to Vision Studio
- Task 3: Extract text from images in the Vision Studio

### Task 1: Create an *Azure AI services* resource

In this task, you will learn how to create an **Azure AI Services** resource to leverage AI capabilities for vision, language, and decision-making.

You can use Azure AI Vision's OCR capabilities with an **Azure AI services** multi-service resource. If you haven't already done so, create an **Azure AI services** resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, Click the **＋ Create a resource** button.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p2(1).png)

1. You will be taken to a page to create an Azure AI services resource. Please click on **Create**.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p3.png)

1. Configure it with the following settings:

    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription* **(1)**
    - **Resource group**: **AI-900-Module-05-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)**
    - **Region**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/> (3)**
    - **Name**: Enter **text<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (4)**
    - **Pricing tier**: *Standard S0* **(5)**
    - **By checking this box, I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below**: *Selected* **(6)**
   - Select **Review + create (7)**

1. Then click on **Create** and wait for deployment to complete.

### Task 2: Connect your Azure AI service resource to Vision Studio

In this task, you will learn how to connect your **Azure AI Services** resource to Vision Studio to enable AI-driven image and video analysis.

Next, connect the Azure AI services resource you provisioned above to Vision Studio.

1. Open a new browser tab and go to **Vision Studio** at [https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com?azure-portal=true)

1. Click on **Sign in** in the top right corner, then log in with your account. Make sure you're using the same directory where you created your Azure AI services resource.

   ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/4-6.png)

   >**Note:** If the **Welcome to the new Vision Studio** pop-up appears, click on **Close**.

   ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4-p2t1p6.png)

1. On the Vision Studio home page, select **View all resources** under the **Getting started with Vision** heading.

    ![The View all resource link is highlighted under Getting started with Vision in Vision Studio.](./media/analyze-images-vision/vision-resources.png)
    
1. On the **Select a resource to work with** page, make sure the resource you created above appears in the list. 

    > **Note**: If your resource isn't listed, try **Refreshing** the page.

      ![](./media/ai900m5-12.png)

1. Close the settings page by selecting the **x** at the top right of the screen.

### Task 3: Extract text from images in the Vision Studio

In this task, you will learn how to extract text from images in Vision Studio using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.
    
1. Copy the following link and paste it in a new tab in the browser.

   ```
   https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/demo/extract-text-from-images
   ```

   ![](./media/mod5-t3p1.png)

1. Under the **Try It Out** subheading, acknowledge **(1)** the resource usage policy by reading and checking the box and select the **Please select a resource (2)**.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod4n2.png)

1. On the **Select an Azure resource** page, choose your existing **Subscription (1)** from the drop-down menu, then select the **AI Service (2)** resource from the **Azure Resources** drop-down, and click **Confirm (3)**.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/mod5-t3p2.png)

1. **Check** the Acknowledge box once more.

1. Open a new tab, copy and paste this link in the browser [**https://aka.ms/mslearn-ocr-images**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-ocr-images) to download **ocr-images.zip**. Then extract the zip folder.

1. Click the **download icon (1)** to view your downloads, then click the **folder icon (2)** to open the file location.
