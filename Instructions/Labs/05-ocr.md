# Module 05: Read text in Vision Studio

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you'll use Azure AI service to explore the optical character recognition capabilities of Azure AI Vision. You'll use Vision Studio to experiment with extracting text from images, without having to write any code.

A common computer vision challenge is to detect and interpret text embedded within an image. This is known as optical character recognition (OCR). In this exercise, you’ll use an Azure AI services resource, which includes Azure AI Vision services. You'll then use Vision Studio to try out OCR with different types of images.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Creating an *Azure AI Speech* resource
- Task 2: Connect your Azure AI service resource to Vision Studio
- Task 3: Extract text from images in the Vision Studio

## Exercise 1: Read the text in Vision Studio

### Task 1: Create an *Azure AI services* resource

In this task, you will learn how to create an **Azure AI Services** resource to leverage AI capabilities for vision, language, and decision-making.

You can use Azure AI Vision's OCR capabilities with an **Azure AI services** multi-service resource. If you haven't already done so, create an **Azure AI services** resource in your Azure subscription.
