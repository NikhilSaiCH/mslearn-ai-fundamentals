# Explore Speech in the Microsoft Foundry portal

## Lab overview

The **Azure AI Speech** service transcribes speech into text and text into audible speech. You might use AI Speech to create an application that can transcribe meeting notes or generate text from the recording of interviews.

In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Speech in the Microsoft Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to transcribe audio using the built-in try-it-out experiences. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Create a project in the Microsoft Foundry portal
- Task 2: Explore speech-to-text in Microsoft Foundry's Speech Playground

### Task 1: Create a project in the Microsoft Foundry portal

In this task, we are creating and configuring a project in Microsoft Foundry to explore AI services and speech capabilities.

### Task 2: Explore speech to text in Microsoft Foundry's Speech Playground

In this task, we are using Azure AI Speech to transcribe audio into text in real time using the Speech Playground.

Let's try out *real-time speech-to-text* in Microsoft Foundry's Speech Playground. 

1. From the left navigation menu, select **AI Services (1)**, then scroll down to the **Infuse your solutions with AI capabilities** and select the **Speech (2)** tile to try out Azure AI Speech capabilities.

   ![](./media/mod9-p2t2p1.png)

1. On the **Speech Playground** page, scroll down and select **Real-time transcription (1)**. Make sure that **Foundry name (2)** is displayed in **Connected resource** placeholder.

   ![](./media/mod9-p2t2p2-1.png)

1. Copy the highlighted link by right-clicking the [**https://aka.ms/mslearn-speech-files**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-speech-files) and selecting "Copy link" from the context menu, and paste it into a new tab to download **Speech.zip**. 

1. Click the **download icon (1)** to view your downloads, then click the **folder icon (2)** to open the file location.

   ![](./media/9-2.png)

1. **Right-click** the **ZIP file (1)**  and select **Extract All (2)** to **unzip** its contents. 

   ![](./media/9-3.png)

1. Select the destination folder, ensure Show extracted files when complete is checked, and click **Extract** to unzip the files. 

   ![](./media/9-4.png)

1. The Speech folder contains **m4a** file named **WhatAICanDo**. 

   ![](./media/mod9-p2t2p3.png)

1. Click **browse files (1)** to upload the **WhatAICanDo.m4a** file, navigate to **`C:\Users\azureuser\Downloads\Speech` (2)**, select **WhatAICanDo.m4a (3)** file, and click **Open (4)** to begin transcription.

   ![](./media/mod9-p2t2p7.png)

1. The Speech service transcribes and displays the text in real time. If you have audio on your computer, you can listen to the recording as the text is being transcribed.

1. The output successfully transcribes the audio, capturing how AI enhances various aspects of life, including healthcare, accessibility, infrastructure, entertainment, and environmental sustainability.
