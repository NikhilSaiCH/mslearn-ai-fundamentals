# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Lab 03: Analyze images in the Microsoft Foundry portal

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you'll explore Azure AI Vision within the Microsoft Foundry portal to analyze images and extract meaningful information. By using built-in experiences, such as caption generation, image tagging, and object detection, you'll understand how to leverage AI to monitor and interpret images, like those from cameras in a "smart store." You'll be able to apply these tools to provide descriptions, tags, and insights into the content of images, supporting applications like customer assistance in retail environment

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to use Azure AI Vision to analyze images and extract information for real-world scenarios. Specifically, you will learn to:

1. **Create a project in Microsoft Foundry portal**: Set up an AI project in the Microsoft Foundry portal to organize and manage your image analysis tasks.

2. **Generate captions and dense captions**: Use Azure AI Vision's captioning capabilities to generate descriptions for images and identify objects within them.

3. **Tag images**: Analyze images and generate a list of descriptive tags, including objects and actions.

4. **Perform object detection**: Identify and label objects within images using bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure and Azure AI services and familiarity with image analysis concepts like captions, tags, and object detection.

## Architecture

In this lab, the architecture flow involves the following components:

1. **Microsoft Foundry Portal**: A centralized platform for creating and managing AI projects. 

2. **Azure AI Vision**: A service used to analyze images, generate captions, detect objects, and tag them with relevant labels.
