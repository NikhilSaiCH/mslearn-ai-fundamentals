Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning

### Overall Estimated timing: 60 Minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience using the **browser-based Machine Learning Lab** to automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models. You will learn how to create a Machine Learning Lab workspace, use automated machine learning to train a regression model, and deploy the best-performing model as a real-time endpoint. By following step-by-step tasks, you'll upload and prepare data, configure an Automated ML job, review model performance, and test predictions using sample input. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how automated machine learning simplifies building and operationalizing predictive models without requiring Azure access or extensive coding.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a workspace in **Machine Learning Lab**, use automated machine learning to train a predictive model, and deploy the model as a real-time endpoint.

1. **Create a Machine Learning Lab workspace**: You will learn how to access the browser-based ML Lab environment and create a workspace to organize datasets, experiments, models, and endpoints.

2. **Train a model using automated machine learning**: You will use automated machine learning to train a regression model that predicts ice cream sales based on seasonal and weather-related features, and evaluate multiple algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

3. **Deploy and test the model**: You will deploy the trained model as a real-time endpoint and test it using sample input data to verify that it returns accurate predictions.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure Machine Learning and machine learning concepts. Familiarity with working in the Azure Portal and understanding of datasets and model training would be beneficial.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture consists of a simplified end-to-end machine learning workflow using the browser-based Machine Learning Lab environment.

1. **Machine Learning Lab Workspace and Automated ML**: A workspace is created in ML Lab, and Automated Machine Learning is used to train a regression model on ice cream sales data by evaluating multiple algorithms and selecting the best-performing model.

2. **Model Deployment as a Real-Time Endpoint**: The selected model is deployed as a real-time endpoint, exposing a service that accepts input data and returns predictions for ice cream demand.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**: A centralized platform for managing machine learning resources, experiments, and models. It allows users to set up, train, and evaluate models efficiently while managing datasets and compute resources.

2. **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**: A feature in Azure Machine Learning that automates the process of model selection, training, and evaluation. It allows users to quickly build and optimize models without extensive coding by trying multiple algorithms and configurations.
