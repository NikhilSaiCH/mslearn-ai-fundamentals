# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 12: Explore generative AI in Azure AI Foundry portal

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

This lab provides an introduction to generative AI through the Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating and deploying intelligent applications. In this exercise, you'll interact with the Chat playground in Azure AI Foundry, where you will explore the deployment of the GPT-4o model, learn how to optimize responses, and understand effective prompting techniques to refine outputs from generative AI.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a project in Azure AI Foundry and analyze a receipt using Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract key information efficiently

1. Create a Project in the Azure AI Foundry portal to organize and set up AI resources.

2. Explore Generative AI in the Azure AI Foundry’s Chat playground, interact with a deployed GPT model, and experiment with response optimization techniques.

## Pre-requisites

Basic Understanding of Generative AI

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Azure AI Foundry Portal**: The platform for creating, managing, and deploying AI models and resources.

2. **Azure AI Project**: A container for organizing your work within the portal.

3. **Chat Playground**: An interactive environment where you can test the deployed model by sending prompts and receiving responses.

4. **Deployment**: The process of deploying the GPT-4o model to make it available for interaction within the playground.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure AI Foundry Portal**: This is the central hub where users can create and manage projects, deploy AI models, and interact with various AI capabilities. It offers a user-friendly interface to experiment with different AI models and services without requiring deep technical knowledge.

2. **Azure AI Project**: A project in the Azure AI Foundry serves as an organizational unit for grouping and managing resources. Each project is linked to a hub, which provides a workspace for various tasks related to AI models, data processing, and exploration.

3. **GPT-4o Model**: The GPT-4o model is a large language model developed by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text. When deployed in the Chat playground, GPT-4o is used to generate responses to user inputs (prompts), which can vary from answering factual questions to providing creative suggestions.

4. **Deployment**: To begin using GPT-4o in the Azure AI Foundry, the model must be deployed first. The deployment process makes the model accessible in the chat playground and allows it to interact with users' inputs.

5. **Chat Playground**: The Chat playground is an interactive interface where you can test the generative AI model by sending different prompts and receiving responses. It allows you to iterate on your prompts, providing insights into how well the model performs and how you can improve its outputs.

6. **Prompting Techniques**: Effective prompting is crucial for optimizing the model's responses. In this lab, you’ll experiment with various techniques to guide the model’s output, such as providing clear instructions, setting expectations, and providing context. You’ll also learn how to iterate on prompts to refine the responses.
