# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 09 : Explore Speech in Microsoft Foundry portal

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience in leveraging Azure AI Speech services within the Microsoft Foundry portal. You will learn how to create and configure an Azure AI Speech project, explore real-time speech-to-text transcription, and work with Azure AI Speech Playground. Through interactive exercises, you will transcribe audio files into text and understand how speech services can be integrated into intelligent applications. By the end of this lab, you will be proficient in using Azure AI Speech for audio transcription, equipping you with the skills to build AI-powered voice applications in your organization’s Azure environment.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a project in Microsoft Foundry and use Azure AI Speech to Text to convert spoken language into written text, extract key insights from audio data, and interpret the results for further processing efficiently.

1. **Create a project in Microsoft Foundry portal**: You will learn about configuring an Microsoft Foundry project, provisioning necessary AI resources, and exploring Vision and Document Intelligence capabilities for automated data extraction.

1. **Explore speech to text in Microsoft Foundry's Speech Playground**: You will learn about using Azure AI Speech to convert spoken language into written text, extract key insights from audio data, and interpret the results for further processing.

1. **Explore text to speech in Microsoft Foundry's Speech Playground**: You will learn about using Azure AI Speech text into spoken language, extract key insights from audio data, and interpret the results for further processing.


## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure AI services and Azure Speech Service.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Microsoft Foundry Portal:** A centralized platform for creating and managing AI projects and accessing built-in AI playgrounds.

1. **Azure AI Speech Service:** A cloud-based AI service that provides speech recognition and speech synthesis capabilities.

1. **Speech Playground:** An interactive environment within Microsoft Foundry used to explore speech-to-text and text-to-speech features without writing code.

1. **Audio Input File:** An audio file used as input for speech-to-text transcription in the Speech Playground.

1. **Text Input:** Text provided as input for text-to-speech synthesis using available voice models.

## Explanation of Components:

1. **Microsoft Foundry Portal:** Microsoft Foundry is the web-based portal used to create and manage AI projects. In this lab, it provides access to the Speech Playground and connects the project to the Azure AI Speech service, enabling hands-on exploration of speech capabilities.

1. **Azure AI Speech Service:**
Azure AI Speech is a managed AI service that enables converting spoken language into text and synthesizing speech from text. In this lab, it processes uploaded audio files for real-time transcription and generates audio output from text using prebuilt voice models.

1. **Speech Playground:**
The Speech Playground is a built-in experience within Microsoft Foundry that allows users to test Azure AI Speech features interactively. It provides tools for real-time speech-to-text transcription and text-to-speech synthesis using preconfigured resources.
