Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 09 : Explore Speech in Azure AI Foundry portal

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience in leveraging Azure AI Speech services within the Azure AI Foundry portal. You will learn how to create and configure an Azure AI Speech project, explore real-time speech-to-text transcription, and work with Azure AI Speech Playground. Through interactive exercises, you will transcribe audio files into text and understand how speech services can be integrated into intelligent applications. By the end of this lab, you will be proficient in using Azure AI Speech for audio transcription, equipping you with the skills to build AI-powered voice applications in your organization’s Azure environment.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a project in Azure AI Foundry and use Azure AI Speech to Text to convert spoken language into written text, extract key insights from audio data, and interpret the results for further processing efficiently.

1. **Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal**: You will learn about configuring an Azure AI Foundry project, provisioning necessary AI resources, and exploring Vision and Document Intelligence capabilities for automated data extraction.

2. **Explore speech to text in Azure AI Foundry's Speech Playground**: You will learn about using Azure AI Speech to Text to convert spoken language into written text, extract key insights from audio data, and interpret the results for further processing.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure AI services and Azure Speech Service.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal**: Understanding how to set up a new project in Azure AI Foundry, including configuring AI resources to support Vision and Document Intelligence capabilities. This involves selecting the appropriate AI models, setting up access permissions, and ensuring the project is properly structured for document processing workflows.

1. **Explore Speech to Text in Azure AI Foundry's Speech Playground**: Learning how to convert spoken language into text using Azure AI Foundry's Speech Playground. This includes uploading or recording audio, analyzing transcriptions, and extracting key insights such as speaker identification, timestamps, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, understanding how to integrate the transcribed data into business applications for automation and enhanced accessibility.
