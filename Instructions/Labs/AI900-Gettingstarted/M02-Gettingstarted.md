# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 02: Explore the Content Safety Studio

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll explore the Azure AI Content Safety Studio to evaluate and moderate text and image content. By creating a Content Safety service, associating it with the studio, and running moderation tests, you’ll gain insights into the severity levels of different types of content. The lab will guide you through exploring text moderation, analyzing results, and checking the necessary keys and endpoints for integrating the service with your applications.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to use Azure AI services effectively. You will learn to:

1. **Create an *Azure AI services* resource in the Azure portal**: Learn how to provision a multi-service AI resource using the Azure portal.

2. **Check out the keys and endpoint**: Locate the authentication credentials required to access Azure AI services via APIs.

3. **See Azure AI services in action**: Explore AI capabilities like face detection using interactive demos in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure and Azure Portal and familiarity with AI concepts related to content moderation.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several key components that showcase how Azure AI services are provisioned and utilized.

1. **Provision an Azure AI multi-service resource**: Learn how to create a centralized Azure AI service resource that provides access to multiple AI capabilities, such as Vision, Language, and Decision services. This involves configuring resource settings like region, pricing tier, and deployment details within the Azure portal.

2. **Explore and test AI capabilities using Azure AI Foundry**: Use the Azure AI Foundry portal to interact with AI services such as Face Detection. This includes accessing demos, analyzing images with AI models, and viewing sample code that integrates the service's keys and endpoints—demonstrating how developers can connect their applications to Azure AI services..

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure AI Content Safety Studio**: A platform within Azure AI designed to manage and moderate text and image content by evaluating it for harmful or inappropriate categories. It provides easy-to-use tools to test and analyze content using AI-based moderation models.

2. **Azure Content Safety Resource**: A service that analyzes content (text and images) and assigns severity scores based on categories like violence, hate speech, or explicit content. This resource is configured within the Azure portal and linked to the Content Safety Studio for testing and integration.
