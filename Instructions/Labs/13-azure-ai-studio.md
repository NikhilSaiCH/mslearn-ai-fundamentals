# Lab 13: Microsoft Foundry

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you will explore the Microsoft Foundry portal and learn how to create, manage, and deploy generative AI models within the Azure ecosystem. You will gain hands-on experience working with Azure AI hubs, projects, and deploying AI models like GPT-40.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will perform:

- Task 1: Open the Microsoft Foundry portal
- Task 2: Create an Azure AI project
- Task 3: Deploy and test a generative AI model

## Exercise 1: Explore the components and tools of the Microsoft Foundry

### Task 1: Open the Microsoft Foundry portal

In this task, you will sign in to the Microsoft Foundry portal and explore its interface, learning how to navigate the platform and access its various features for managing AI resources.

1. In a edge browser, open https://ai.azure.com and **Sign in** using your Azure credentials. The home page of Azure AI Studio looks similar to the following image:

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

### Task 2: Create an Microsoft Foundry Resources

In this task, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up a collaborative workspace for AI projects and configuring essential resources.

1. On the Microsoft Foundry portal home page, in the **Help** window, select **Create a project**. In Microsoft Foundry, projects are containers that help organize your work.

1. On the **Create a project** pane, enter the following:

   - Project name **Myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
   - Click on the dropdown for **Advanced Options (2)**.
   - Select **AI-900-Module-13-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group (3)
   - Click **Create** (4)
