# Lab 13: Azure AI Foundry

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you will explore the Azure AI Foundry portal and learn how to create, manage, and deploy generative AI models within the Azure ecosystem. You will gain hands-on experience working with Azure AI hubs, projects, and deploying AI models like GPT-40.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will perform:

- Task 1: Naviagte to Microsoft Foundry and create a project
- Task 2: Deploy and test a generative AI model

## Exercise 1: Explore the components and tools of Microsoft Foundry

### Task 1: Naviagte to Microsoft Foundry and create a project

In this task, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up a collaborative workspace for AI projects and configuring essential resources.

1. On the Azure Portal page, in the Search resources, services, and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Microsoft Foundry (1)**, and then select **Microsoft Foundry (2)** under **Services**.

1. On the **Create a Foundry resource** pane, enter the following:

   - Subscription: **Leave default subscription** 
   - Resource group: **AI-900-Module-13-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** **(1)**
   - Name:  **MyFoundry<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)**
   - Region: **<inject key="Location" enableCopy="false"></inject>** **(3)**
   - Default project name: **Myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (4)**
   - Click **Review+Create** **(5)**

1. Return to the Microsoft Foundry browser tab.

## Task 2: Deploy and test a generative AI model

1. In the navigation pane on the left for your project, select **Playgrounds (1)** and click on  **Try the Chat Playground (2)**.

   ![](media/tcp.png)

1. In the window that appears, ensure that your **gpt-4o (1)** model deployment is selected.

1. In the Setup pane, in the Give the model instructions and context box, enter the instruction as: **You are a history teacher who can answer questions about past events all around the world. (2)** and click on **Apply Changes (3)**

   ![](media/ins.png)

1. For the **Update system message?** prompt, click on **Continue**

   ![](media/usm.png)

1. In the chat window, enter a query such as **What are the key events in the history of Scotland? (1)**  and press **send button (2)** to view the response.
